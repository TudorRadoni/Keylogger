# Log Interpreter

The script translates logs from the Keylogger into human-readable text.
It print the text to the console and saves it to a file named `output.txt`, which is placed in the same directory as the script.

## Usage

To use the script, you need to have Python installed.

Use `-h` or `--help` to see the available options.

```bash
$ python log2text.py logfile.log
Here is the interpreted log.
Output written to <current_path>/output.txt
```
